# About
As C++11 has already made lambda expression a part of the language itself,
it seems nonsense to use boost::lambda any more. But still, I believe
using Generic programmaing only to create lambda itself is cool. And
through this project, I can really practise a lot.

So I just implement another lambda library according to the boost::lambda.
With the help of C++11, type dedeunction can be a lot easier. I implement
placeholders and nearly all the operators for lambda, and there's only
245 lines of code in `lambda.h`.
